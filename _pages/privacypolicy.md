## 1.0 Information Collection and Usage
To assist in improving Flashcard Adder, we keep copies of crash logs collected by Apple. This information is collected on an opt-in basis and requires user consent before crash logs are sent to both us and Apple. Access to crash logs makes it easier to diagnose and squash bugs.

### 1.1 Information you provide to us 
No personally identifiable information is collected in our log data. Nothing you type in our app is visible to us unless you voluntarily choose to share it to us when contacting us for any comments or support.
